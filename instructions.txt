What is SDLC?
  SDLC is the software development life cycle, which is a process used to develop software.
What are the stages of SDLC? explain
  1.Planning. 
  2.Define requirements
  3.Designing and prototyping
  4.Software development
  5.Testing
  6.Deployment
  7.Operations and Maintenance
Define five SDLC moldels (methodology).
  Waterfall Model: Each stage of development flows into itself, without making edits to previous phases.
  V-Shaped Model: Each stage of development is tested directly after, and then goes onto the next stage.
  Iterative Model: Every change made to a program is tested until the product is complete. This causes a new version of the software to be made every edit.
  Spiral Model: The software passes through the four phases over and over until the process is complete.
  Big Bang Model: Little to no software or planning is used, and is not recommended for larger projects.
Take one of the SDLC models and explain the implementation process.
  The implementation process of the spiral model is
Describe how to apply SDLC model in the version control App.
  The waterfall model would be the most effective model for the version control app, because of it being a smaller program. Some planning would be needed due to it having text, so a script of the text would be needed.
